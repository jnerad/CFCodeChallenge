step 1
"Cutup" an image into HTML and CSS so it looks similar in a modern web browser. *  
The image can be found here --> http://d3vj7y74cpj7c1.cloudfront.net/01_preview3.jpg. Do the best you can without spending too much time on it (i.e. it doesn't need to be perfect, if you are missing a detail here or there it's OK). Please do not share this image or consult anyone for help (Internet searching own your own is fine). When you are done, commit the code to a public Github.com profile and share the URL to the repository with us here.

step 2
Using jQuery, attempt to make the ingredients section from question #1 interactive. *  
For example, make it as if you were checking off the times while baking the cake. When you are done, push the commit(s) to the GitHub repository from question #1 and paste in the URL to the last commit here.
